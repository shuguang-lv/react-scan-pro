# Contributing to React Scan Pro

Thanks for your interest in contributing to React Scan Pro! This document covers the project layout, dev setup, and the workflow for getting your change merged.

## Project Structure

This is a pnpm 10 monorepo orchestrated by [turbo](https://turbo.build) and built on [Vite+](https://viteplus.dev) (oxlint, oxfmt, tsdown).

```
packages/
├── scan/                    # Core React Scan Pro library + CLI
├── extension/               # Browser extension (Chrome / Firefox / Brave)
├── vite-plugin-react-scan-pro/  # Vite plugin wrapper
└── website/                 # Marketing site (Next.js, react-scan-pro.com)

kitchen-sink/                # Playwright target app (Vite, port 5173)
e2e/                         # Playwright specs
docs/installation/           # Per-framework install guides
```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 22
- pnpm >= 10

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shuguang-lv/react-scan-pro.git
cd react-scan-pro
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

### Dev workflow

```bash
pnpm dev                                    # watches react-scan-pro + kitchen-sink in parallel
pnpm --filter react-scan-pro build:copy         # build and copy IIFE to clipboard for ad-hoc testing
pnpm --filter @react-scan-pro/extension dev     # extension in Chrome
pnpm --filter @react-scan-pro/website dev       # marketing site
```

## Code Style

We use [Vite+](https://viteplus.dev) which bundles oxlint and oxfmt. See [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for the full rule set.

```bash
pnpm lint            # check
pnpm lint:fix        # auto-fix
pnpm format          # write
pnpm format:check    # verify
pnpm check           # lint + format:check + typecheck
pnpm typecheck
```

Highlights:

- TypeScript everywhere; avoid `any`.
- Interfaces over types; kebab-case filenames.
- Arrow functions over function declarations.
- No comments unless the "why" is non-obvious. Hacks must be prefixed with `// HACK: …`.
- Magic numbers in `constants.ts` with `_MS` / `_PX` unit suffixes.
- One utility per file under `utils/`.

## Tests

```bash
pnpm test              # vitest in each package
pnpm test:e2e          # Playwright against kitchen-sink (auto-started on :5173)
pnpm test:e2e:ui       # Playwright UI mode
```

## Pull Requests

1. Fork and create a branch (`git checkout -b feat/your-feature`).
2. Make your changes; run `pnpm check` and `pnpm test:e2e` before pushing.
3. If your change affects a published package, add a changeset:
   ```bash
   pnpm changeset
   ```
4. Open a PR against `main`. Tag [@aidenybai](https://github.com/aidenybai) for review.

### Commit Convention

We use conventional commits:

- `feat:` New features
- `fix:` Bug fixes
- `docs:` Documentation
- `chore:` Maintenance
- `refactor:` Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- `test:` Tests

Example: `fix(scan): handle null fiber in flash overlay`
