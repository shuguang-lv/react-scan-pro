React Scan Pro automatically detects performance issues in your React app.

Previously, tools like:

- [`<Profiler />`](https://react.dev/reference/react/Profiler) required lots of manual changes
- [Why Did You Render?](https://github.com/welldone-software/why-did-you-render) lacked simple visual cues
- [React Devtools](https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2018/09/10/introducing-the-react-profiler.html) didn't have a simple, portable, and programmatic API

React Scan Pro attempts to solve these problems:

- It requires no code changes – just drop it in
- It highlights exactly the components you need to optimize
- Use it via script tag, npm, CLI, you name it!

### CLI

If you don't have a local version of the site or you want to test a React app remotely, you can use the CLI. This will spin up an isolated browser instance which you can interact or use React Scan Pro with.

```bash
npx react-scan-pro@latest http://localhost:3000
# you can technically scan ANY website on the web:
# npx react-scan-pro@latest https://react.dev
```

You can add it to your existing dev process as well. Here's an example for Next.js:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "scan": "next dev & npx react-scan-pro@latest localhost:3000"
  }
}
```

### Browser Extension

If you want to install the extension, follow the guide [here](https://github.com/shuguang-lv/react-scan-pro/blob/main/BROWSER_EXTENSION_GUIDE.md).

### React Native

See [discussion](https://github.com/shuguang-lv/react-scan-pro/pull/23)

## `react-scan-pro/lite`: headless instrumentation

A tiny, UI-less entry point that taps into the same React DevTools profiling channel the Timeline Profiler uses. No toolbar, no canvas, no styles. Just a stream of commit / render / state-update events you can pipe to a callback or POST to an endpoint. Pairs naturally with a `long-animation-frame` `PerformanceObserver` so you can attribute a slow LoAF to a specific component subtree.

```ts
import { instrument } from "react-scan-pro/lite";

const handle = instrument({
  onEvent: (event) => console.log(event),

  // optional: POST every event to an ingest endpoint
  endpoint: "http://127.0.0.1:54321/ingest/abc123",
  sessionId: "abc123",

  // optional: enrich each fiber summary
  recordChangeDescriptions: true, // why did this re-render? (props/state/context/hooks/parent)
  includeFiberSource: true, // file:line of each fiber's JSX call site
  includeFiberIdentity: true, // stable id across commits, for cascade histograms
});

handle.subscribe((event) => {
  if (event.kind === "commit") {
    // event.tree[] = per-fiber { name, fiberId, depth, actualDuration,
    //                            source, ownerName, changeDescription }
    // event.priorityName = "UserBlocking" | "Normal" | ...
  }
  if (event.kind === "profiling-hooks-status" && !event.available) {
    // React 19.2+ prod or non-__PROFILE__ build: mark* hooks won't fire.
    // Fall back to LoAF-only attribution.
  }
});

handle.stop(); // idempotent
```

`instrument` must run before `react-dom` mounts (top of your entry, or as the first script in `<head>`). It's SSR-safe: calling `instrument()` in Node returns a noop handle whose `isActive()` is `false`.

### Per-fiber enrichment

| Option                     | Default | What you get                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `recordChangeDescriptions` | `false` | `changeDescription: { isFirstMount, props[], state, context, hooks[], parent }` per fiber. Answers "why this re-rendered" in a single event.          |
| `includeFiberSource`       | `false` | `source: { fileName, lineNumber, columnNumber }` + `ownerName`, read from `_debugSource` (R16/17/18) or `_debugStack` (R19+). Sync, no symbolication. |
| `includeFiberIdentity`     | `false` | `fiberId: number`, stable monotonic id per logical fiber (alternate-aware), so the agent can build cross-commit histograms.                           |
| `includeLaneLabels`        | `true`  | `laneLabels: string[]` (translated via `renderer.getLaneLabelMap()`) and `priorityName` (e.g. `"UserBlocking"`)                                       |
| `maxFibersPerCommit`       | `5000`  | Cap on tree size per commit to bound payload size                                                                                                     |
| `minFiberActualDurationMs` | `0`     | Skip fibers below this threshold                                                                                                                      |

### Build profile

`actualDuration` and the `mark*` profiling hooks only populate in `__PROFILE__` builds. In development that's the default; in production you can opt in by aliasing `react-dom` to `react-dom/profiling` in your bundler (`resolve.alias` in webpack/vite). Otherwise `onCommitFiberRoot` still fires but every fiber's `actualDuration` is `0`. The `profiling-hooks-status` event makes this explicit: `available: false` with `reason: "no-inject-method"` means React 19.2+ in prod or a non-`__PROFILE__` build, so the agent should fall back to LoAF-only attribution rather than concluding "idle".

### Coexistence with React DevTools

If React DevTools is also attached, `instrument()` logs a one-time warning: the `injectProfilingHooks` channel is a hard replace, so DevTools' Timeline Profiler stops receiving events while this instrumentation is active. Call `handle.stop()` to restore.

</details>

- `scan(options: Options)`: Imperative API to start scanning
- `useScan(options: Options)`: Hook API to start scanning
- `getReport()`: Get a report of all the renders
- `setOptions(options: Options): void`: Set options at runtime
- `getOptions()`: Get the current options
- `onReport(listener)`: Subscribe to completed scan-session reports
- `getLastReport()`: Read the most recently completed report
- `onRender(Component, onRender: (fiber: Fiber, render: Render) => void)`: Hook into a specific component's renders

### Session report

```ts
scan({
  enabled: false,
  scope: { kind: "component-name", name: "App" },
  report: {
    mode: "summary",
    onComplete: (report) => console.log(report.components),
  },
});

setOptions({ enabled: true });
setOptions({ enabled: false });
```

The toolbar includes a **Session reports** panel for the latest completed capture. It displays
aggregated component metrics or virtualized Raw records and provides **Copy** and **Export JSON**
actions without retaining a second in-memory copy of the report.

The script build exposes the same data through `window.reactScanPro.onReport()` and
stores the latest result for `window.reactScanPro.getLastReport()`:

```html
<script>
  window.__REACT_SCAN_PRO_OPTIONS__ = {
    enabled: false,
    report: { mode: "summary", limit: 100 },
  };
</script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-scan-pro/dist/auto.global.js"></script>
<script>
  const unsubscribe = window.reactScanPro.onReport((report) => {
    console.log(report);
    // For iframes, also configure allowInIframe: true.
    window.parent.postMessage({ type: "react-scan-pro:report", report }, "*");
  });

  window.reactScanPro.setOptions({ enabled: true });
  // Exercise the app, then synchronously complete the session.
  window.reactScanPro.setOptions({ enabled: false });
</script>
```

Listeners receive JSON-safe reports and may upload them with `fetch()`. `onReport()` returns an
unsubscribe function, and `window.reactScan` remains a 0.1.x compatibility alias with the same
methods.

## Why React Scan Pro?

React can be tricky to optimize.

The issue is that component props are compared by reference, not value. This is intentional – this way rendering can be cheap to run.

However, this makes it easy to accidentally cause unnecessary renders, making the app slow. Even in production apps, with hundreds of engineers, can't fully optimize their apps (see [GitHub](https://github.com/shuguang-lv/react-scan-pro/blob/main/.github/assets/github.mp4), [Twitter](https://github.com/shuguang-lv/react-scan-pro/blob/main/.github/assets/twitter.mp4), and [Instagram](https://github.com/shuguang-lv/react-scan-pro/blob/main/.github/assets/instagram.mp4)).

This often comes down to props that update in reference, like callbacks or object values. For example, the `onClick` function and `style` object are re-created on every render, causing `ExpensiveComponent` to slow down the app:

```jsx
<ExpensiveComponent onClick={() => alert("hi")} style={{ color: "purple" }} />
```

React Scan Pro helps you identify these issues by automatically detecting and highlighting renders that cause performance issues. Now, instead of guessing, you can see exactly which components you need to fix.

### FAQ

**Q: Why this instead of React Devtools?**

React Devtools aims to be a general purpose tool for React. However, I deal with React performance issues every day, and React Devtools doesn't fix my problems well. There's a lot of noise (no obvious distinction between unnecessary and necessary renders), and there's no programmatic API. If it sounds like you have the same problems, then React Scan Pro may be a better choice.

Also, some personal complaints about React Devtools' highlight feature:

- React Devtools "batches" paints, so if a component renders too fast, it will lag behind and only show 1 every second or so
- When you scroll/resize the boxes don't update position
- No count of how many renders there are
- I don't know what the bad/slow renders are without inspecting
- The menu is hidden away so it's annoying to turn on/off, user experience should be specifically tuned for debugging performance, instead of hidden behind a profiler/component tree
- No programmatic API
- It's stuck in a chrome extension, I want to run it anywhere on the web
- It looks subjectively ugly (lines look fuzzy, feels sluggish)
- I'm more ambitious with react-scan-pro

## Acknowledgments

React Scan Pro takes inspiration from the following projects:

- [React Devtools](https://react.dev/learn/react-developer-tools) for the initial idea of [highlighting renders](https://medium.com/dev-proto/highlight-react-components-updates-1b2832f2ce48). We chose to diverge from this to provide a [better developer experience](https://x.com/aidenybai/status/1857122670929969551)
- [Million Lint](https://million.dev) for scanning and linting approaches
- [Why Did You Render?](https://github.com/welldone-software/why-did-you-render) for the concept of hijacking internals to detect unnecessary renders caused by "unstable" props
